# LZW-Compression-Decompression
The Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm. LZW is an adaptive compression algorithm that does not assume prior knowledge of the input data distribution. This algorithm works well when the input data is sufficiently large and there is redundancy in the data. Two examples of commonly used file formats that use LZW compression are the GIF image format served from websites and the TIFF image format. LZW compression is also suitable for compressing text files, and is the algorithm in the compress Unix file compression utility. This algorithm has two steps: 1. Encoding/Compressing 2. Decoding/Decompressing
